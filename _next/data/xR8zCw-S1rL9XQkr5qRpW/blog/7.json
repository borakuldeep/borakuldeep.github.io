Even though the upgrades are marginal often. I am a big fan of\n          small and portable camera with no interchangeable lens, yet with\n          advantages of several lenses, similar to smartphones of today. So, my\n          ideal camera would be very similar to smartphones but with bigger\n          sensors and dedictaed functionality of photography. What would that\n          camera look like? This is my take on that.\n        </p>\n        <h2>User requirements</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Smaller form factor</li>\n          <li>Great image quality</li>\n          <li>Professional video features</li>\n          <li>Ease of use</li>\n          <li>cheaper price (~$1000)</li>\n          <li>Great looking design (subjective)</li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"section\">\n        <h2>Design</h2>\n      <p>\n        The designs are based on google pixel original phone as I was big fan of\n        it's camera system.\n      </p>\n      </div>\n      \n      <div class=\"section\">\n        <h2>wireframe - Camera front</h2>\n        <div class=\"figure\">\n          <ul>\n            <li>This is the camera front / top view.</li>\n            <li>The camera is inspired by smartphones.</li>\n            <li>\n              The camera has multiple lens for different shooting situations.\n              These sensors should be larger than a typical smartphones.\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n          <Image src=\"../images/camera-front.png\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"section\">\n        <h2>wireframe - Camera bottom side</h2>\n        <div class=\"figure\">\n          <ul>\n            <li>This is the view from side-bottom.</li>\n            <li>\n              The bottom of camera has a tripod mount and battery container.\n              Minimalist design :)\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              A good amount of hand grip needed for better handling. On second\n              thought, the grip can be used to hold battery just like other\n              cameras. This will allow a bigger battery.\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n          <Image src=\"../images/camera-side1.png\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"section\">\n        <h2>wireframe - Camera side angle</h2>\n        <div class=\"figure\">\n          <ul>\n            <li>This view shows headphone / mic ports and SD card slot.</li>\n            <li>\n              Also present is usb-c and mini micro ports for charing and data\n              transfer.
