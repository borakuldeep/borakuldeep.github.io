Even though the upgrades are marginal often. I am a big fan of small and portable camera with no interchangeable lens, yet with advantages of several lenses, similar to smartphones of today. So, my ideal camera would be very similar to smartphones but with bigger sensors and dedictaed functionality of photography. What would that camera look like? This is my take on that. </p><h2 data-v-9e5c83f0>User requirements</h2><ul data-v-9e5c83f0><li data-v-9e5c83f0>Smaller form factor</li><li data-v-9e5c83f0>Great image quality</li><li data-v-9e5c83f0>Professional video features</li><li data-v-9e5c83f0>Ease of use</li><li data-v-9e5c83f0>cheaper price (~$1000)</li><li data-v-9e5c83f0>Great looking design (subjective)</li></ul></div><h2 data-v-9e5c83f0>Design</h2><p data-v-9e5c83f0> The designs are based on google pixel original phone as I was big fan of it&#39;s camera system. </p>',4),A={class:"section"},S=m("h2",null,"wireframe - Camera front",-1),I={class:"figure"},x=m("ul",null,[m("li",null,"This is the camera front / top view."),m("li",null,"The camera is inspired by smartphones."),m("li",null," The camera has multiple lens for different shooting situations.
